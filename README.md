## About
This project aims to automate the core e-commerce customer journey by testing product search, add to cart, and checkout processes. Specifically, it will validate the ability to search for a specific product (e.g., 18-inch black gaming laptop with Intel Core i9), add it to the cart, and complete the checkout process by entering correct delivery and billing information.

For this Maven Project, I have used:
- Data Driven Testing ( stored Test Data in a JSON format)
- Page Object Models
- Java OOP Concepts like Inheritence & Encapsulation
- Used Access Control (Private & Protected)
- Used log4j2 to document each action
- Used Java library Lombok to minimize/remove the boilerplate code
- CI/CD pipeline
